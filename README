WMS-Setup is a setup wizard for the HSTI Mobostick(tm) and Wirelss Media Stick(tm)

WMS-Setup is mainly intended for Linux users who do not want to struggle
with the console or find the manual ACSII to HEX conversation not convenient.
The usage itself is very similar to the wizards for Windows or Mac PC's provided
with the sticks. Anyway both sticks work well in a Linux only environment.

HOWTO - build and run
---------------------

1) get the source (via git or the download option)

2a) build and run with ant
~$> cd WMS-Setup
~$> ant run

2b) build and run with Netbeans
- open the project in Netbeans
- SHIFT-F11 (clean and build)
- F6 (run project)


HOWTO - use
-----------

- enter the necessary data
   MAC ID         : the MAC address of the wireless access point / router
                    example: 00CAFEBABE00
   SSID           : the SSID of the wireless network
                    example: my_home_wifi
   password       : WIFI passphrase to connect to the network
   security type  : one of "open", "WEP", "WPA", "WPA2"
   encryption type: one of "n/a", "TKIP", "AES"

- mount the setup drive provided by the stick
  Mobostick           : the drive label is "Setup"
  Wireless Media Stick: the drive label is "WMS Setup"

- click on the "save" button in WMS-Setup and select the related setup path
  (the mount point names might differ on your Linux distribution)
  Mobostick           : /mount/Setup/wms
  Wirelss Media Stick : /mount/WMS Setup/wms

Short after you clicked on the OK button the stick will be unmounted and reboot
automatically. As soon the LED stops flashing you can configure the stick via
the buildin webfrontend (only Wireless Media Stick) or the related Android apps.
